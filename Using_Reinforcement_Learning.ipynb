Sharma for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J.\\nThe petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation (the \\\"Corpo ration\\\").\\nThey are termed as daily rated employees.\\nIn this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\".\\nThey demand payment in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services.\\nThey want the same pay of the regular employees as carpenters or in the alternative, the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner for like categories of workmen.\\nThey also seek regularisation of their services with the benefits of pen sion, gratuity etc.\\nThe Corporation has resisted the petitioners ' claim.\\nThe case of the Corporation is that the unit where the petition ers are working is a factory registered under the Factories Act.\\nThe petitioners are treated as industrial workmen and .are given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations.\\nThe Government has not fixed the mini mum wages payable to the petitioners engaged in the Corpora tion or other like industries, but the Corporation has adopted the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construction industry.\\nThey are being paid the same wages as are payable to carpenters, painters and carpenters ' helpers engaged in the construction industry.\\nThey are given bonus under the Bonus Act and provident fund benefits under the Employees ' Provident Fund Act.\\nIt is also stated that the petitioners are supplied with the necessary tools for carry ing out their work and also working uniforms like aprons and overalls.\\nThe Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners ' categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to the petitioners, the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.\\nA little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.\\nThe Corporation is a company which has been incorporated under the .\\nThe main object of the Corporation as seen from the Memorandum of Associa tion is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and also to popularise handicrafts and handloom items 665 in the State of Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country and abroad.\\nIn order to achieve this primary objec tive, the Corporation gives training to artisans, weavers and craftsmen in various traditional arts and crafts.\\nDuring the period of training, the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.\\nUpto 31st March, 1987, the Corporation has imparted training to as many as 1662 persons in different areas like carpet weaving, handloom weaving, painting, metal crafts, wood carving, etc.\\nApart from giving training, the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.\\nIt is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.\\nIt is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases, they execute the work in their own homes.\\nThe financial aspect of the Corporation is stated to be not encouraging, and indeed, it is disappointing.\\nIt has suffered huge loss and the total losses accumulated hitherto is Rs.69.77 lakhs.\\nNonetheless, for the purpose of preserv ing and promoting traditional arts and crafts, the Corpora tion has been kept alive.\\nBut to avoid or minimise further loss, it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.\\nWith these facts, we may now turn to the principle upon which the petitioners ' case is rested.\\nThe principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" is not one of the fundamental rights expressly guaranteed by our Constitution.\\nThe princi ple was incorporated only under Article 39(d) of the Consti tution as a Directive Principle of State Policy.\\nPerhaps, for the first time, this Court in Randhir Singh vs Union of India, ; has innovated that it is a constitu tional goal capable of being achieved through constitutional remedies.\\nThere the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also to Article 16 which declares that there should be equality of opportu nity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.\\nRandhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.\\nHe claimed equal salary for equal work at that of other drivers.\\nThe Court found that the petitioner therein performed the same func 666 tions and duties as other drivers in the service of Delhi Administration.\\nThe Court, therefore, directed the Central Government to fix the pay scale of the petitioner on par with his counterparts doing identical work under the same employer.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the decision in Randhir Singh case, there were bumper cases filed in this Court for enforcement of the right to \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\", perhaps little realising the in built restrictions in that principle.\\nIt may not be necessary here to refer to all those decisions since almost all of them have been consid ered and explained in the recent two decisions to which one of us was a party (K. Jagannatha Shetty, J.).\\nReference may be made to: (i) State of U.P. vs J.P. Chaurasia, ; and (ii) Meva Ram Kanojia vs All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Anr., ; In Chaurasia case the question arose whether it was permissible to have two different pay scales in the same cadre of Bench Secre taries of the Allahabad High Court who were for all practi cal purposes performing similar duties and having same responsibilities.\\nThe Court held that the principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.\\nArticle 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.\\nIt is, therefore, not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.\\nIt was pointed out that in service, merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency in administration and he or she learns also by experience as much as by other means.\\nApart from that, the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.\\nMeva Ram Kanojia is the most recent decision which has exhaustively dealt with all the principles bearing on the question of equal pay for equal work in the light of all the previous decisions of this Court.\\nThere the petitioner was a \\\"Hearing Therapist\\\" in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.\\nHe claimed pay scale admissible to \\\"Senior Speech Pathologist\\\", \\\"Senior Physiotherapist\\\", \\\"Senior Occupational Therapist\\\", \\\"Audiologist\\\", and \\\"Speech Pathologist\\\".\\nHis case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as \\\"Senior Speech Therapist\\\", \\\"Senior Physiotherapist\\\", \\\"Senior Occupa tional Therapist\\\", \\\"Audiologist\\\" and \\\"Speech Pathologist\\\".\\nBut the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.\\nIt was also held 667 that it is open to the State to classify employees on the basis of qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the posts concerned.\\nIf the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved, efficiency in the administration, the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.\\nReference may also be made to the decision in Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Stenographers (Recognised) vs Union of India, ; There the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to the Heads of Department in Customs and Central Excise Department of the Ministry of Finance made a claim for parity of wages with the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to Joint Secretaries and Officers above them in Ministry of Finance.\\nThe Court while rejecting the claim expressed the view (at 100): \\\"But equal pay must depend upon the nature of the work done, it cannot be judged by the mere volume of work, there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility.\\nFunctions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.\\nOne cannot deny that often the difference is a matter of degree and that there is an element of value judgment by those who are charged with the administration in fixing the scales of pay and other conditions of service.\\nSo long as such value judgment is made bona fide, reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.\\nIt is important to emphasize that equal pay for equal work is a concomitant of Article 14 of the Constitution.\\nBut it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right.\\\" Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.\\nIn the light of the aforesaid principles, we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.\\nWe have carefully perused the material on record and gave our anxious consideration to the question urged.\\nFrom the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.\\nEvidently the petitioners are claiming wages payable to the carpenters in Government service.\\nWe do not think that 668 we could accept their claim.\\nIn the first place, even assum ing that the petitioners ' jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service, the petitioners cannot enforce the right to \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\".\\nThe discrimination complained of must be within the same estab lishment owned by the same management.\\nA comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.\\nUnless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" cannot be enforced.\\nThis was also the view expressed in Meva Ram Kanojia vs A.I.I.M.S., ; at 245.\\nIn the instant case, the petitioners are employed by a company incorporated under the .\\nThey cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.\\nSecondly, it may be noted that the petitioners are carpenters; better called as craftsmen.\\nBy the general description of their job, one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.\\nThe two jobs by the mere nomen clature or by the volume of work performed cannot be rated as equal.\\nIt is not just a comparison of physical activity.\\nIt requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.\\nThe accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.\\nIt cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.\\nIt must be left to be evaluated and determined by expert body.\\nThe principal claim of the petitioners therefore fails and is rejected.\\nThe next contention that the petitioners should be paid at least the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commis sioner under Exhibit P. 2 dated March 20, 1986 cannot also be accepted.\\nexhibit P. 2 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner in the exercise of his powers under the H.P. Financial Rules.\\nIt is applicable only to skilled and unskilled work ers in class IV employees in Government service.\\nIt has not been extended to employees of the Corporation.\\nThe petition ers have been treated as construction workers and they are being paid the minimum wages admissible to such workmen.\\nThe Court, therefore, cannot direct the Corporation to apply the rates prescribed under exhibit P. 2 unless the Government makes it applicable to employees of the Corporation.\\nAs to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners, 669 we express no opinion, since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.\\nWe leave the petitioners to work out their rights elsewhere in accordance with law applicable to them.\\nIn the result, the petition fails and is dismissed.\\nIn the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.\\nP.S.S.

Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the respondent No. 1.\\nMarch 24, 1964.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.\\nThis appeal arises out of an industrial dispute as regards the age of retirement.\\nThe first respondent, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in January, 1946 as a Private Limited Company to take over the business of the partnership firm of the Shaw Wallace & Co., which had been ,doing business in India for about 60 years.\\nIn July.\\n1947 the Private Limited Company was converted into a Public Limited Company.\\nThe Head Office of the Company is at Calcutta.\\nIt has Branches in Bombay, Delhi and Via Madras.\\nThe general practice of the Company both at the Head Office and the Branch Offices appears to have been to retire its employees at the age of 55 though in certain cases the Company in its discretion permitted an employee to continue beyond that age.\\nIn September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the Company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age ,of 55.\\nShortly after this the Company 's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age.\\nThey claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he bad completed 60 years of age.\\nThis dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra.\\nBefore the Tribunal the Company resisted the workmen 's claim but submitted that it was agreeable to introduce for its Bombay employees provisions similar to those which had been introduced by agreement for the Calcutta employees retirement at the age of 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55.\\nThe Tribunal has directed that the age of retirement should be 58 but the Company may in its discretion and with the express or implied consent of the employee concerned continue an employee after he attains that age.\\nIt is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the workmen.\\nAs has already been noticed there is no dispute that the age of compulsory retirement should not remain at 55.\\nThe dispute is whether it should be fixed at 58 or at 60.\\nIt is interesting to refer in this connection to the information that has been collected by the Pay Commission (1957 59) as regards the pensionable ages prescribed under the Pension Insurance Schemes for employees generally or for industrial 426 employees and under social assistance or universal schemes in forty eight countries in 1954.\\nAccording to this the pensionable age is 70 in two countries; 67 in another two; 65 in twenty four, 60 in seventeen, 55 in two and 50 in one.\\nThus out of 48 countries for which information was available it was found that in 45 countries the pensionable age was fixed at 60 or more.\\nAs the Pay Commission Report pointed out: \\\"This is particularly remarkable, considering that the countries differ widely in demographic constitution, levels of economic development, and climatic and social condition; and it indicates a virtual unanimity of competent opinion that balancing the various factors physiological, economic and social that are relevant, the normal working life should continue up to the age of 60, and may well go on up to 65 years.\\nIt is undoubtedly more useful, however, and indeed essential for our present purpose to examine the trends in this matter in our own country and specially in the region in which the present dispute has arisen.\\nIn the delicate task of adjust ing needs of the employees to the interests of the employers and what is even more important to the general interests of the country at large, industrial adjudication has to pay special attention to the prevailing practice in the industrial region concerned.\\nIf in any particular region employees have been successful in their claim for fixing the age of retirement at 60 this very success is bound to raise in others in the region similar expectations.\\nRefusal of similar relief to them is likely to create discontent.\\nIt is the endeavour of industrial adjudication to prevent this.\\nThat is why on questions of age of retirement and hours of work and other similar matters industrial tribunals attach much weight to what has been done in other industrial concerns in the neighbourhood in recent timeswhether by agreement or by adjudication.\\nIn support of their demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 the workmen tried to show that in recent years at least the tendency in comparable concerns in Bombay region has been to fix the retirement age at 60.\\nThe Chart which is marked exhibit U 5 mentions 50 concerns in which the age of retirement is 60.\\nIn several of these this age had been fixed as far back as 1950 while in the rest the age was fixed in later years, that is, between 1952 and 1961.\\nThe workmen claim that these showed clearly a tendency in the Bombay region to fix the age of retirement in comparable concerns at 60.\\nSpecial emphasis was naturally placed on some decisions of this Court which contained pronouncements as regards the existence of such a trend.\\nIn Imperial Chemical Industries 427 (India) Private Ltd., vs The Workmen(1) where the Tribunal had raised the age of retirement from 55 to 58 and both parties appealed, this Court pointed out that one of the documents on the record \\\"would conclusively show that in Bombay the age of retirement is almost invariably fixed at 60 and not at 55\\\".\\nIn an earlier decision of this Court in Dunzlop Rubber Co. Ltd., vs Workmen(2) it had been urged that the employer was an All India concern and that changing the terms and conditions of service in regard to the age of retirement in one place might unsettle the uniformity and might have serious repercussions in other branches.\\nThe Court pointed out that though this was a relevant consideration its effect had to be judged in the light of other material and relevant circumstances, and that one of the important material considerations in this connection would be that the age of retirement can be and often is determined on industry cum region basis.\\nThe Court then took into account the fact that the Tribunal had found that in all the awards in recent times in various concerns in Bombay region the trend had been to fix the age of retire ment at 60 years.\\nIt was mainly in view of this finding of the Tribunal that this Court refused to disturb the award fixing the age of retirement at 60 years.\\nIt is important to notice that the correctness of the Tribunal 's finding that in all the awards in recent times in the Bombay region the trend had been to fix the retirement age at 60 years, was not challenged before this Court In the present case an attempt appears to have been made on behalf of the respondent Company to show that it was not correct to say that the trend in Bombay region had been to fix the age of retirement at 60.\\nReliance was placed for this purpose on the Chart exhibit Cl.\\nIt appears that the res pondent company wrote to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce to ascertain from its member concerns as regards the age of retirement observed by them and the information received from some of them was incorporated in this Chart.\\nThe work men objected to this being received in evidence on the ground that the original letters had not been brought on the record.\\nIt is not however seriously disputed that the Chart correctly reproduces the information as regards the age of retirement given by the various concerns named there.\\nWe think therefore that the objection was rightly rejected by the Tribunal.\\nThis Chart shows the age of retirement for 75 concerns.\\nIn most of the cases the age of retirement is shown as 55 and in a few at 58.\\nAt first sight therefore it appears to afford impressive (1) ; (2) ; 428 testimony against the workmen 's case that the recent trend in Bombay has been to fix the age of retirement at 60.\\nBut on a closer examination it is clear that this document is of little assistance for finding out the recent trend.\\nThere is no indication at all as to how long ago the age of retirement in these concerns was fixed at 55 or at 58.\\nThe Statement filed by the workmen to explain this Chart shows that in two of these cases ' viz., Ingerzoll Band and Northern Assurance Co., the demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 years is under negotiation.\\nExhibit U 6 also shows that in 25 of these concerns the clerical and subordinate staff were not organised into trade unions.\\nThere is thus good ground for thinking that the. reason why these concerns have kept the age of retirement at 55 or 58 are special to them and do not show any recent trend in the matter.\\nIn spite of these infirmities this document, exhibit Cl, appears to have impressed the Tribunal.\\nThe main diffi culty in accepting the Company 's case on this point, viz., the pronouncements of this Court, however, remained.\\nSo, the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by this Court in some of its earlier decisions as to the relevant trend in the Bombay region was accurate.\\nHaving embarked an this enquiry, the Tribunal, appears to have taken considerable pains to perform this duty and it has ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend is established in fact.\\nWe ought to add in this connection, that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable, and that its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.\\nIf this Court had erred in making those pronouncements we would be the first to admit such mistakes and to correct the error.\\nAfter careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, we have, however, found nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion.\\nOn the contrary, the awards and agreements on the question of age of retirement about which information is furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.\\nThe very few departures from this practice which the Tribunal has mentioned are, in our opinion, wholly insufficient to indicate any slowing down of this trend.\\nWhat the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter.\\n429 Notice has also to be taken in this connection of the Report of the Norms Committee in which the following opinion was expressed: \\\"After taking into consideration the views of the earlier Committees and Commissions including those of the Second Pay Commission the report of which has been released recently, we feel that the retirement age for workmen in all industries should be fixed at 60.\\nAccordingly, the norm for retirement age is fixed at 60\\\".\\nThis considered opinion of a Committee on which both employers and employees were represented emphasised the fact that in the Bombay region at least there is a general agree ment that the age of retirement should be fixed at 60.\\nThe Tribunal has referred to these observations, but has brushed them aside in a way for which we find no justification.\\nOn a consideration of all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the oral and documentary evidence on this record, we have come to the conclusion that the age of retirement of the appellant workmen should be fixed at 60.\\nAccordingly, we allow the appeal with costs, and in modi fication of the award made by the Tribunal direct that the age of retirement for the workmen of the respondent be fixed at 60.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n\",\n          \"Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.\\nKozhikode, in I.D. No. 89 of 1958.\\nA. V. Viswanatha Sastri and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.\\nJanuary 29.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.\\nThis is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.\\nThe brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \\\"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.\\nWe are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \\\"to hire and fire\\\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.\\nAs far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.\\nThe reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.\\nIn any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.\\nBut the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.\\nIt satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.\\nIn the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.\\nWe have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.\\n(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.\\nStress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: \\\"It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.\\nIt is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.\\nIt is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.\\nArticles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.\\nNo such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.\\nFurther an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \\\"to hire and fire\\\" his employees.\\nThat right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.\\nThe appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).\\nThe industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nIn this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.\\nThe appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.\\nIt could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).\\nThat case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.\\nThe appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Sharma for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J.\\nThe petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation (the \\\"Corpo ration\\\").\\nThey are termed as daily rated employees.\\nIn this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\".\\nThey demand payment in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services.\\nThey want the same pay of the regular employees as carpenters or in the alternative, the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner for like categories of workmen.\\nThey also seek regularisation of their services with the benefits of pen sion, gratuity etc.\\nThe Corporation has resisted the petitioners ' claim.\\nThe case of the Corporation is that the unit where the petition ers are working is a factory registered under the Factories Act.\\nThe petitioners are treated as industrial workmen and .are given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations.\\nThe Government has not fixed the mini mum wages payable to the petitioners engaged in the Corpora tion or other like industries, but the Corporation has adopted the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construction industry.\\nThey are being paid the same wages as are payable to carpenters, painters and carpenters ' helpers engaged in the construction industry.\\nThey are given bonus under the Bonus Act and provident fund benefits under the Employees ' Provident Fund Act.\\nIt is also stated that the petitioners are supplied with the necessary tools for carry ing out their work and also working uniforms like aprons and overalls.\\nThe Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners ' categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to the petitioners, the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.\\nA little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.\\nThe Corporation is a company which has been incorporated under the .\\nThe main object of the Corporation as seen from the Memorandum of Associa tion is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and also to popularise handicrafts and handloom items 665 in the State of Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country and abroad.\\nIn order to achieve this primary objec tive, the Corporation gives training to artisans, weavers and craftsmen in various traditional arts and crafts.\\nDuring the period of training, the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.\\nUpto 31st March, 1987, the Corporation has imparted training to as many as 1662 persons in different areas like carpet weaving, handloom weaving, painting, metal crafts, wood carving, etc.\\nApart from giving training, the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.\\nIt is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.\\nIt is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases, they execute the work in their own homes.\\nThe financial aspect of the Corporation is stated to be not encouraging, and indeed, it is disappointing.\\nIt has suffered huge loss and the total losses accumulated hitherto is Rs.69.77 lakhs.\\nNonetheless, for the purpose of preserv ing and promoting traditional arts and crafts, the Corpora tion has been kept alive.\\nBut to avoid or minimise further loss, it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.\\nWith these facts, we may now turn to the principle upon which the petitioners ' case is rested.\\nThe principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" is not one of the fundamental rights expressly guaranteed by our Constitution.\\nThe princi ple was incorporated only under Article 39(d) of the Consti tution as a Directive Principle of State Policy.\\nPerhaps, for the first time, this Court in Randhir Singh vs Union of India, ; has innovated that it is a constitu tional goal capable of being achieved through constitutional remedies.\\nThere the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also to Article 16 which declares that there should be equality of opportu nity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.\\nRandhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.\\nHe claimed equal salary for equal work at that of other drivers.\\nThe Court found that the petitioner therein performed the same func 666 tions and duties as other drivers in the service of Delhi Administration.\\nThe Court, therefore, directed the Central Government to fix the pay scale of the petitioner on par with his counterparts doing identical work under the same employer.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the decision in Randhir Singh case, there were bumper cases filed in this Court for enforcement of the right to \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\", perhaps little realising the in built restrictions in that principle.\\nIt may not be necessary here to refer to all those decisions since almost all of them have been consid ered and explained in the recent two decisions to which one of us was a party (K. Jagannatha Shetty, J.).\\nReference may be made to: (i) State of U.P. vs J.P. Chaurasia, ; and (ii) Meva Ram Kanojia vs All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Anr., ; In Chaurasia case the question arose whether it was permissible to have two different pay scales in the same cadre of Bench Secre taries of the Allahabad High Court who were for all practi cal purposes performing similar duties and having same responsibilities.\\nThe Court held that the principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.\\nArticle 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.\\nIt is, therefore, not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.\\nIt was pointed out that in service, merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency in administration and he or she learns also by experience as much as by other means.\\nApart from that, the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.\\nMeva Ram Kanojia is the most recent decision which has exhaustively dealt with all the principles bearing on the question of equal pay for equal work in the light of all the previous decisions of this Court.\\nThere the petitioner was a \\\"Hearing Therapist\\\" in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.\\nHe claimed pay scale admissible to \\\"Senior Speech Pathologist\\\", \\\"Senior Physiotherapist\\\", \\\"Senior Occupational Therapist\\\", \\\"Audiologist\\\", and \\\"Speech Pathologist\\\".\\nHis case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as \\\"Senior Speech Therapist\\\", \\\"Senior Physiotherapist\\\", \\\"Senior Occupa tional Therapist\\\", \\\"Audiologist\\\" and \\\"Speech Pathologist\\\".\\nBut the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.\\nIt was also held 667 that it is open to the State to classify employees on the basis of qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the posts concerned.\\nIf the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved, efficiency in the administration, the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.\\nReference may also be made to the decision in Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Stenographers (Recognised) vs Union of India, ; There the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to the Heads of Department in Customs and Central Excise Department of the Ministry of Finance made a claim for parity of wages with the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to Joint Secretaries and Officers above them in Ministry of Finance.\\nThe Court while rejecting the claim expressed the view (at 100): \\\"But equal pay must depend upon the nature of the work done, it cannot be judged by the mere volume of work, there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility.\\nFunctions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.\\nOne cannot deny that often the difference is a matter of degree and that there is an element of value judgment by those who are charged with the administration in fixing the scales of pay and other conditions of service.\\nSo long as such value judgment is made bona fide, reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.\\nIt is important to emphasize that equal pay for equal work is a concomitant of Article 14 of the Constitution.\\nBut it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right.\\\" Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.\\nIn the light of the aforesaid principles, we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.\\nWe have carefully perused the material on record and gave our anxious consideration to the question urged.\\nFrom the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.\\nEvidently the petitioners are claiming wages payable to the carpenters in Government service.\\nWe do not think that 668 we could accept their claim.\\nIn the first place, even assum ing that the petitioners ' jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service, the petitioners cannot enforce the right to \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\".\\nThe discrimination complained of must be within the same estab lishment owned by the same management.\\nA comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.\\nUnless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of \\\"equal pay for equal work\\\" cannot be enforced.\\nThis was also the view expressed in Meva Ram Kanojia vs A.I.I.M.S., ; at 245.\\nIn the instant case, the petitioners are employed by a company incorporated under the .\\nThey cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.\\nSecondly, it may be noted that the petitioners are carpenters; better called as craftsmen.\\nBy the general description of their job, one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.\\nThe two jobs by the mere nomen clature or by the volume of work performed cannot be rated as equal.\\nIt is not just a comparison of physical activity.\\nIt requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.\\nThe accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.\\nIt cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.\\nIt must be left to be evaluated and determined by expert body.\\nThe principal claim of the petitioners therefore fails and is rejected.\\nThe next contention that the petitioners should be paid at least the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commis sioner under Exhibit P. 2 dated March 20, 1986 cannot also be accepted.\\nexhibit P. 2 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner in the exercise of his powers under the H.P. Financial Rules.\\nIt is applicable only to skilled and unskilled work ers in class IV employees in Government service.\\nIt has not been extended to employees of the Corporation.\\nThe petition ers have been treated as construction workers and they are being paid the minimum wages admissible to such workmen.\\nThe Court, therefore, cannot direct the Corporation to apply the rates prescribed under exhibit P. 2 unless the Government makes it applicable to employees of the Corporation.\\nAs to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners, 669 we express no opinion, since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.\\nWe leave the petitioners to work out their rights elsewhere in accordance with law applicable to them.\\nIn the result, the petition fails and is dismissed.\\nIn the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.\\nP.S.S.

Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the respondent No. 1.\\nMarch 24, 1964.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.\\nThis appeal arises out of an industrial dispute as regards the age of retirement.\\nThe first respondent, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in January, 1946 as a Private Limited Company to take over the business of the partnership firm of the Shaw Wallace & Co., which had been ,doing business in India for about 60 years.\\nIn July.\\n1947 the Private Limited Company was converted into a Public Limited Company.\\nThe Head Office of the Company is at Calcutta.\\nIt has Branches in Bombay, Delhi and Via Madras.\\nThe general practice of the Company both at the Head Office and the Branch Offices appears to have been to retire its employees at the age of 55 though in certain cases the Company in its discretion permitted an employee to continue beyond that age.\\nIn September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the Company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age ,of 55.\\nShortly after this the Company 's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age.\\nThey claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he bad completed 60 years of age.\\nThis dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra.\\nBefore the Tribunal the Company resisted the workmen 's claim but submitted that it was agreeable to introduce for its Bombay employees provisions similar to those which had been introduced by agreement for the Calcutta employees retirement at the age of 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55.\\nThe Tribunal has directed that the age of retirement should be 58 but the Company may in its discretion and with the express or implied consent of the employee concerned continue an employee after he attains that age.\\nIt is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the workmen.\\nAs has already been noticed there is no dispute that the age of compulsory retirement should not remain at 55.\\nThe dispute is whether it should be fixed at 58 or at 60.\\nIt is interesting to refer in this connection to the information that has been collected by the Pay Commission (1957 59) as regards the pensionable ages prescribed under the Pension Insurance Schemes for employees generally or for industrial 426 employees and under social assistance or universal schemes in forty eight countries in 1954.\\nAccording to this the pensionable age is 70 in two countries; 67 in another two; 65 in twenty four, 60 in seventeen, 55 in two and 50 in one.\\nThus out of 48 countries for which information was available it was found that in 45 countries the pensionable age was fixed at 60 or more.\\nAs the Pay Commission Report pointed out: \\\"This is particularly remarkable, considering that the countries differ widely in demographic constitution, levels of economic development, and climatic and social condition; and it indicates a virtual unanimity of competent opinion that balancing the various factors physiological, economic and social that are relevant, the normal working life should continue up to the age of 60, and may well go on up to 65 years.\\nIt is undoubtedly more useful, however, and indeed essential for our present purpose to examine the trends in this matter in our own country and specially in the region in which the present dispute has arisen.\\nIn the delicate task of adjust ing needs of the employees to the interests of the employers and what is even more important to the general interests of the country at large, industrial adjudication has to pay special attention to the prevailing practice in the industrial region concerned.\\nIf in any particular region employees have been successful in their claim for fixing the age of retirement at 60 this very success is bound to raise in others in the region similar expectations.\\nRefusal of similar relief to them is likely to create discontent.\\nIt is the endeavour of industrial adjudication to prevent this.\\nThat is why on questions of age of retirement and hours of work and other similar matters industrial tribunals attach much weight to what has been done in other industrial concerns in the neighbourhood in recent timeswhether by agreement or by adjudication.\\nIn support of their demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 the workmen tried to show that in recent years at least the tendency in comparable concerns in Bombay region has been to fix the retirement age at 60.\\nThe Chart which is marked exhibit U 5 mentions 50 concerns in which the age of retirement is 60.\\nIn several of these this age had been fixed as far back as 1950 while in the rest the age was fixed in later years, that is, between 1952 and 1961.\\nThe workmen claim that these showed clearly a tendency in the Bombay region to fix the age of retirement in comparable concerns at 60.\\nSpecial emphasis was naturally placed on some decisions of this Court which contained pronouncements as regards the existence of such a trend.\\nIn Imperial Chemical Industries 427 (India) Private Ltd., vs The Workmen(1) where the Tribunal had raised the age of retirement from 55 to 58 and both parties appealed, this Court pointed out that one of the documents on the record \\\"would conclusively show that in Bombay the age of retirement is almost invariably fixed at 60 and not at 55\\\".\\nIn an earlier decision of this Court in Dunzlop Rubber Co. Ltd., vs Workmen(2) it had been urged that the employer was an All India concern and that changing the terms and conditions of service in regard to the age of retirement in one place might unsettle the uniformity and might have serious repercussions in other branches.\\nThe Court pointed out that though this was a relevant consideration its effect had to be judged in the light of other material and relevant circumstances, and that one of the important material considerations in this connection would be that the age of retirement can be and often is determined on industry cum region basis.\\nThe Court then took into account the fact that the Tribunal had found that in all the awards in recent times in various concerns in Bombay region the trend had been to fix the age of retire ment at 60 years.\\nIt was mainly in view of this finding of the Tribunal that this Court refused to disturb the award fixing the age of retirement at 60 years.\\nIt is important to notice that the correctness of the Tribunal 's finding that in all the awards in recent times in the Bombay region the trend had been to fix the retirement age at 60 years, was not challenged before this Court In the present case an attempt appears to have been made on behalf of the respondent Company to show that it was not correct to say that the trend in Bombay region had been to fix the age of retirement at 60.\\nReliance was placed for this purpose on the Chart exhibit Cl.\\nIt appears that the res pondent company wrote to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce to ascertain from its member concerns as regards the age of retirement observed by them and the information received from some of them was incorporated in this Chart.\\nThe work men objected to this being received in evidence on the ground that the original letters had not been brought on the record.\\nIt is not however seriously disputed that the Chart correctly reproduces the information as regards the age of retirement given by the various concerns named there.\\nWe think therefore that the objection was rightly rejected by the Tribunal.\\nThis Chart shows the age of retirement for 75 concerns.\\nIn most of the cases the age of retirement is shown as 55 and in a few at 58.\\nAt first sight therefore it appears to afford impressive (1) ; (2) ; 428 testimony against the workmen 's case that the recent trend in Bombay has been to fix the age of retirement at 60.\\nBut on a closer examination it is clear that this document is of little assistance for finding out the recent trend.\\nThere is no indication at all as to how long ago the age of retirement in these concerns was fixed at 55 or at 58.\\nThe Statement filed by the workmen to explain this Chart shows that in two of these cases ' viz., Ingerzoll Band and Northern Assurance Co., the demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 years is under negotiation.\\nExhibit U 6 also shows that in 25 of these concerns the clerical and subordinate staff were not organised into trade unions.\\nThere is thus good ground for thinking that the. reason why these concerns have kept the age of retirement at 55 or 58 are special to them and do not show any recent trend in the matter.\\nIn spite of these infirmities this document, exhibit Cl, appears to have impressed the Tribunal.\\nThe main diffi culty in accepting the Company 's case on this point, viz., the pronouncements of this Court, however, remained.\\nSo, the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by this Court in some of its earlier decisions as to the relevant trend in the Bombay region was accurate.\\nHaving embarked an this enquiry, the Tribunal, appears to have taken considerable pains to perform this duty and it has ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend is established in fact.\\nWe ought to add in this connection, that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable, and that its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.\\nIf this Court had erred in making those pronouncements we would be the first to admit such mistakes and to correct the error.\\nAfter careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, we have, however, found nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion.\\nOn the contrary, the awards and agreements on the question of age of retirement about which information is furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.\\nThe very few departures from this practice which the Tribunal has mentioned are, in our opinion, wholly insufficient to indicate any slowing down of this trend.\\nWhat the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter.\\n429 Notice has also to be taken in this connection of the Report of the Norms Committee in which the following opinion was expressed: \\\"After taking into consideration the views of the earlier Committees and Commissions including those of the Second Pay Commission the report of which has been released recently, we feel that the retirement age for workmen in all industries should be fixed at 60.\\nAccordingly, the norm for retirement age is fixed at 60\\\".\\nThis considered opinion of a Committee on which both employers and employees were represented emphasised the fact that in the Bombay region at least there is a general agree ment that the age of retirement should be fixed at 60.\\nThe Tribunal has referred to these observations, but has brushed them aside in a way for which we find no justification.\\nOn a consideration of all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the oral and documentary evidence on this record, we have come to the conclusion that the age of retirement of the appellant workmen should be fixed at 60.\\nAccordingly, we allow the appeal with costs, and in modi fication of the award made by the Tribunal direct that the age of retirement for the workmen of the respondent be fixed at 60.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n\",\n          \"Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.\\nKozhikode, in I.D. No. 89 of 1958.\\nA. V. Viswanatha Sastri and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.\\nJanuary 29.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.\\nThis is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.\\nThe brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \\\"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.\\nWe are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \\\"to hire and fire\\\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.\\nAs far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.\\nThe reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.\\nIn any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.\\nBut the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.\\nIt satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.\\nIn the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.\\nWe have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.\\n(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.\\nStress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: \\\"It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.\\nIt is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.\\nIt is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.\\nArticles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.\\nNo such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.\\nFurther an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \\\"to hire and fire\\\" his employees.\\nThat right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.\\nThe appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).\\nThe industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nIn this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.\\nThe appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.\\nIt could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).\\nThat case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.\\nThe appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
